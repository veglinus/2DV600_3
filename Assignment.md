# 2DV600 -Assignment 3: Graphs and Algorithms
This assignment consists of three parts.

In the first part, you should implement a directed graph according to a given set of interfaces.
In the second part, you should implement a few simple algorithms.
Finally, in the third part, you should present (and motivate) a time-complexity estimate for a few of your implemented algorithms. 

Submission: Following two files are required for submission:

A zip file archiving all your .java (source) files.
A report document in doc, docx or pdf format. The report must contain the Java source code for all your solutions and other details required for the solution. Images are not allowed to show the code. The report must be submitted as a stand-alone file, i.e., it must not be compressed as zip or any other file format.
Separate submission of both the report and the zip file is mandatory to pass the assignment, otherwise, a submission will get a grade "F".
Submissions through Email or any way other than Moodle are not accepted.
Your solutions should be your own! You are not allowed to copy from other students, books articles, blogs, wikis, or any other source! Each submission will pass through a plagiarism/clone detection system before correction. If plagiarism is detected, the assignment is failed and a formal investigation will be initiated. 
Grading: Your submission will receive a grade from A to F where F is Failed. You are allowed to improve your work after the initial submission before the deadline. Donâ€™t forget to submit! The grade is final, i.e., you will not get an opportunity to improve after grading.

## Part 1: Graph Implementations
You should provide one implementation of a graph that implements interface graphs.DirectedGraph that uses the node class graphs.Node. The Java code for these and other interfaces and classes used in this assignment can be found here. Read the instructions in the javadoc files carefully before you start.

Important 1: To simplify the testing, later on, you must follow a given name schema. 

Assume that your LNU user-name is X (e.g. na222fx) then:

* All your code should be in a package named X.
* The graph class (one that you implement) should be named X.MyGraph and
* the node class should be named X.MyNode
Furthermore, the graph class must contain a default constructor MyGraph() generating an empty graph.

**Important 2**: We have put together a JUnit test case to help you verify the correctness of your graph implementation.

* The graph JUnit test case TestDirectedGraph can be found in the package graphs.test
* Passing this JUnit test is a minimum criterion to pass this assignment. (That is if your graph implementation not passes this test you will receive a grade F and be asked to hand in a new improved version after the course has been completed.)

## Part 2: Simple Algorithms
You should provide a set of algorithm implementations. These algorithms are specified by a set of interfaces and abstract classes. Your task is to implement:

* A class X.MyGML that extends the abstract class graphs.GML
* A GML mark-up example: GML in Wikipedia
* More information about GML
* More information about Yed 
Yed is a tool to download and install. Yed is also available online as a web application. We recommend you download the tool since the webapp doesn't handle the GML format that well.  (Alternatively, generate GraphML and use the webapp.)

* A class X.MyDFS that implements graphs.DFS
* A class X.MyBFS that implements graphs.BFS
* A class X.MyTransitiveClosure that implements graphs.TransitiveClosure
* A class X.MyConnectedComponents that implements graphs.ConnectedComponents
These algorithms must not depend on any special features in your graph implementation (MyGraph, MyNode). They should work on any implementation of the DirectedGraph and Node interfaces.

Your implementation shouldn't be too slow. You can find a benchmark for testing the performance of your graph in the graphs.benchmark package. It should take a reasonable time for the benchmark to run on your implementation. More information about these algorithms is presented during the graph lecture. 

**Important: We have put together a JUnit test case to help you verify the correctness of your algorithms.

* The algorithm JUnit test cases TestDFS and TestAlgorithms can be found in the package graphs.test
* Once again, passing these JUnit tests is a minimum criterion to pass this assignment.

## Part 3: Time complexity Estimates
This is a theoretical exercise. You should calculate the time complexity O(...) for your implementations of the following algorithms:

* Depth-First Search as implemented in X.MyDFS.dfs(DirectedGraph<E> graph)
* Breadth-First Search as implemented in X.MyBFS.bfs(DirectedGraph<E> graph)
* Transitive Closure as implemented in X.MyTransitiveClosure.computeClosure(DirectedGraph<E> graph)
* Connected Components as implemented in X.MyConnectedComponents.computeComponents(DirectedGraph<E> graph)
* Each of the calculations should come with a brief description/motivation. 

Notice: Make sure that you give a proper reference in your report if you have taken your ideas from a book, article, or some resource found on the Internet. This holds for both the time complexity estimates and the algorithm implementations.
